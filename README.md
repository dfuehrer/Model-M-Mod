# keyboard
* Arduino sketch that works meh for windows and menu keys
    * they occasionally miss the release so ill have to make the code gooder later
* needa add pics later too but
* used khail choc brown switches cause theyre low profile to sit on the plastic
* used the 3d model included to support them up, leaves room to run wires in
